# cheztone-frontend [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ChezTone/cheztone-frontend.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ChezTone/cheztone-frontend)

ChezToneFrontEnd project was used as a sandbox for testing [AngularJSÂ®](https://angularjs.org/). It should be used as a template to build other angularJS projects as it comes will all building and integration tools needed to be tested and installed on a production server.

## Stack

HTML5 and CSS3 project, build on [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) and [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)
We're using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) to build project and run some repetitive tasks and [Bower](https://bower.io/) for dependency management.
